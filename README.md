## Project Overview

The **Mental Health Analytics Dashboard** is an interactive dashboard built in **Microsoft Excel** to analyze mental health survey data and uncover patterns related to stress levels, mental health conditions, treatment-seeking behavior, workload, sleep quality, exercise habits, job satisfaction, and demographic characteristics.

The project transforms raw survey data into actionable insights that can help organizations, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers better understand factors influencing mental well-being.

- What is the overall stress level among participants?
- How many individuals seek professional treatment?
- How do work hours relate to mental health conditions?
- What role do sleep and exercise play in mental well-being?
- Are there differences in stress levels across countries?
